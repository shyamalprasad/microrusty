This is a personal project that will probably be of no value to most
people.

To learn [The Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) I
bought myself a [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/new-microbit/) and
decided I would learn to boot it using Rust. In the process I was also
hoping to learn me some ARM architecture and assembly language.

Nothing here is particularly original. It's a hodgepodge of ideas
(poorly) stolen from

  * [The Rust
    Embedonomicon](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/embedonomicon/preface.html).
  * [The Rust Embedded Discovery
    Guide](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/index.html).
  * The [cortex_m_rt](https://docs.rs/cortex-m-rt/0.7.1/cortex_m_rt/)
    crate.
  * The [microbit](https://github.com/nrf-rs/microbit) crate.
	
This is just my way of learning from my own mistakes. Don't use this
code for anything but another, probably rotten, way to do what the the
properly developed crates are doing in a properly maintained manner.
